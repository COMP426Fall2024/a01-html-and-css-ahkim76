        <p class="text">Here is some information about me</p>
        <p class="yapping">I'm Alex, and I'm a current sophomore studying computer science @ UNC. I'm from Chicago, Illinois and I really like deep dish pizza. It's pretty
            sad that nobody eats deep dish pizza here. I personally don't really like New York style pizza with thin crusts. This year, I hope to get a SWE internship
            somewhere. I really want to work at Fidelity or Cisco. I like coding full-stack applications, especially with using the React library and Supabase. Although
            I know how to use web frameworks, it has been a while since I used pure HTML and CSS, so this assignment is a fun challenge for me. I think
            for this class's final project, I want to try using a different framework like Angular or Vue. I also know that they use Angular in COMP 590, and I want to take
            that class next semester. Currently, I'm also taking COMP 211, COMP 550, and STOR 120. I'm taking less credits this semester because I was planning on double
            majoring, but dropped it because I realized that there's no point since I just want to go into SWE. Even with three COMP classes, I think the class with the largest
            workload is probably STOR 120 lol.
        </p>

        <p class="yapping">A fun fact about me is that last semester in my freshman year, I studied abroad in Ireland. The best part of the experience
            was not Ireland itself, but rather the extremely cheap flights to other European countries. Here is one of my boarding passes to France. The plane
            ticket was around $18. Hover over the image to see a cool animation I still remember how to implement. All you have to do is translateY a little
            bit and increase the box-shadow to look like it's hovering out of the screen.
